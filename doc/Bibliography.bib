abstract = {The cubic Laves phase of YCo 2 is near a transition from a paramagnetic to a magnetically ordered state. Self-consistent energy-band calculations yield the total energy and the magnetic moment as functions of volume. The new fixed spin-moment (FSM) method, which allows one to calculate the total energy as an explicit function of the magnetisation, is introduced. At the theoretical equilibrium volume YCo 2 is found to be a strongly enhanced Pauli paramagnet, but at a slightly larger lattice constant a metamagnetic transition seems possible. Its occurrence can be understood on the basis of a double minimum in the total energy obtained from the present FSM calculations, which lead to an estimated critical field of about 350 T. In the magnetic state the Y moment is coupled antiferromagnetically to the Co moment.},

abstract = {A recent tight-binding scheme provides a method for extending the results of first principles calculations to regimes involving {\$}10{\^{}}2 - 10{\^{}}3{\$} atoms in a unit cell. The method uses an analytic set of two-center, non-orthogonal tight-binding parameters, on-site terms which change with the local environment, and no pair potential. The free parameters in this method are chosen to simultaneously fit band structures and total energies from a set of first-principles calculations for monatomic fcc and bcc crystals. To check the accuracy of this method we evaluate structural energy differences, elastic constants, vacancy formation energies, and surface energies, comparing to first-principles calculations and experiment. In most cases there is good agreement between this theory and experiment. We present a detailed account of the method, a complete set of tight-binding parameters, and results for twenty-nine of the alkaline earth, transition and noble metals.},

abstract = {An efficient parameterized self-consistent tight-binding model for transition metals using s, p and d valence atomic orbitals as a basis set is presented. The parameters of our tight-binding model for pure elements are determined from a fit to bulk ab-initio calculations. A very simple procedure that does not necessitate any further fitting is proposed to deal with systems made of several chemical elements. This model is extended to spin (and orbital) polarized materials by adding Stoner-like and spin-orbit interactions. Collinear and non-collinear magnetism as well as spin-spirals are considered. Finally the electron-electron intra-atomic interactions are taken into account in the Hartree-Fock approximation. This leads to an orbital dependence of these interactions, which is of a great importance for low-dimensional systems and for a quantitative description of orbital polarization and magneto-crystalline anisotropy. Several examples are discussed.},
